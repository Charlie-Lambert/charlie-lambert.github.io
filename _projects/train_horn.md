This project started as a joke between my friends and coworkers while we were looking at hand drills that had been converted into train horns. Needing something to grab attention during school events, the joke quickly turned into a real project.

I found some scrap electrical components, including a buck converter, a lithium polymer battery, a battery charging circuit, and a trigger switch. All I was missing was the horn and a handle. I discovered plenty of electric horns on eBay, priced between $10 and $20â€”a really cheap way to cause some chaos. I also found a sheet of 0.100-inch scrap metal and decided it would be perfect for the handle. Using SolidWorks, I modeled a series of plates that could be cut on a laser cutter and welded together.

Aside from some soldering, the handle was the major fabrication component of this project. I was fortunate enough to gain access to a fiber laser and cut all the metal plates. After TIG welding the tabs and slots, I had a completed handle. This handle might be one of my favorite metalworking projects!

Whether it's waking someone up in the morning, sneaking up on someone, or rallying a group, this train horn has definitely been a success!
