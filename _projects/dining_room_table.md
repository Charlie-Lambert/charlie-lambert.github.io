After adding electricity and water to our cabin, some more regular ammenities needed to be improved. First on the docket was the dining room table. The previous table was simply a slab of plywood with thin veneer, leaving a lot to be improved on.

The project began when my dad aquired a nice live edge slab taken from a fallen tree near the cabin. This slab set the dimensions for the top of the table driving much of the design. Armed with an existing set of chairs and bench the height of the table was already decided. Now all that was needed was a frame to hold the table top. I sketched a few designs for a table that invovled fancy plate cutting and tube bending, but ended up deciding on a much simpler form shown in Figure 1. This frame was a simple set of square and rectuangular tube that would be welded together with four adjustable feet.

When designing this table I already knew that I had access to a 4 axis fiber laser, which allowed me to use some tricks that would save me time durring fabrication. Most notably I was able to add tab and slot features shown in Figure 2 that made putting the table together like putting legos together.

Because of the tab and slots that were cut into the frames fabrication of this table was super easy. The steel that was used was ordered online, so to reduce weight the gauge of the tubes were fairly light. Because of this I TIG welded the frame together. Once the frame was weleded together it was powder coated and then the table top was secured to the top. Finally the table was installed shown in Figure 3.
