My families off grid cabin is very off grid. It has no electricity, running water, and dare I say cell service. Each time we make our way up there we fill up a serries of large bottles that will be our drinking water for the week. Whenever we wash dishes we fill up a bag of water, boil it, and add bleach to ensure it is clean. While I love getting a workout in carrying water everywhere it is definity a problem that needs to be solved. After installing solar pannels and an electrical system we are finally ready to take on the project.

Water systems have two sides: clean and grey. The clean water system describes the sourcing, cleaning, and distributing the water to faucets and a shower. The grey water system describes how used water is collected and treated. Both systems will be described in this project.

Building this project was quite the adventure. After working through specifiying all of the parts I designed a stand, shown next to the water tank.
