Avid maker and adventurer, currently focused on building robots and rockets.

Over the past two summers, Iâ€™ve been designing and integrating micron and sub-micron in-line metrology systems.

Outside of the office, lab, or machine shop, you can find me mountain biking, mountaineering, and backpacking!
